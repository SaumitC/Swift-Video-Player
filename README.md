## Project Title: Swift Video Player

## Current Status:
The project is progressing well, and we are on track with our development timeline. We have completed the initial design phase and have started implementing core functionalities of the video player application using Swift for macOS development.

## Pending Use Cases:
Subtitle Support: Implementation of subtitle loading and display functionality is pending.
Settings and Preferences: Integration of settings and preferences management both in the frontend and backend is yet to be done.

## Challenges Faced:
Compatibility Issues: We encountered unexpected compatibility issues with certain video formats, requiring additional research and debugging.
UI Design Iterations: Iterative changes in UI design based on user feedback have slightly impacted our development schedule.

##Version Control System:
Our code is stored on GitHub in this repo

Conducting user testing sessions to gather feedback on UI/UX design and functionality.
Benchmarking performance metrics such as playback speed, resource consumption, and responsiveness.
Stress testing the application with large video files and playlists to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## On-Track Assessment:
We are currently on track with our development goals. However, to ensure continued progress before presentation, we plan to prioritize completing pending functionalities, particularly subtitle support and settings management. Additionally, we aim to conduct thorough testing and refinement to deliver a polished application by the next milestone.

## Post Mid-Term Progress Report Milestone:
Our team is committed to delivering a high-quality desktop video player application that meets the outlined use cases and exceeds user expectations. With effective collaboration and focused efforts, we anticipate significant progress in the upcoming weeks, leading to the successful completion of our project goals.
